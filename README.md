# layouts

Welcome. This is a general repository for front-end design work I've done. These aren't functional; instead, they're mock-ups. Consider these a waystation on the UX route from wireframe to functional prototype.

<h1>BetterBurger</h1> was initially designed for a class assignment. I never got the project to function, mostly because of my utter lack of backend skills. But like any good design-obsessed noob, I built the front end first with HTML and CSS. Which was lovely. Except that as I later discovered, sometimes you have to split your front-end between two different pages (the euphemestically named handlebars). So, fail. And yet, win. So now I know more about how to build out the front end.

And I have a nice responsive demo page in rough sketch iteration:

Borders are for design reference only, fwiw.
